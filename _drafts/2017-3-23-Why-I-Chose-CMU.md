I recently made one of the most important decisions of my short twenty two year old life. I have chosen to spend the next five to seven years as a PhD Student at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Why I Chose to to Apply to Grad School
Grad school wasn't always a goal of mine, but rather one that I developed through my undergraduate career.

My first summer of college, I was looking for a job. The primary motivations for this were practical: I needed money to continue my degree. I was taking a upper division pilot Software Engineering course with [Professor Stephen Fickas](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/People/Faculty/Stephen_Fickas.php). It was very engaging, and I was doing more than the minimum. Steve noticed, and offered me a summer job as a Research Assistant.

I like [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) as a way to generalize the factors which motivate people. It asserts that there are an ordered list of needs, from basal "Physiological" needs such as food and water, all the way up to higher "Self Actualization" needs which might include the belief that one is doing personally meaningful work. Before a need can be satisfied, all of the needs lower in Maslow's Hierarchy must be satisfied.

When Steve offered me a job, I saw this as a way to fulfill more basal needs. The fact it was a research assistantship didn't register: it was just a well paying job that would allow me to support myself and save some money to pay for the next term of school. But though the summer I learned that I had not been hired to be programmer but a researcher: my thoughts were valued in research meetings, and I was expected to make intelligent decisions when it came to design tradeoffs. By the end of the summer, I had begun to see research as a way to fulfill higher-order needs: it was the highest up Maslow's pyramid I had climbed so far in any job.

## Why I Chose to Apply to UW, GA Tech, Berkeley and CMU
I first made a list of all Schools in which there were at least a couple faculty members whose research interests were aligned with mine. My research interests span This wasn't easy: many professors' websites are out of date, and their listed interests do not correspond with

**Why didn't I get into Berkeley?** I have no idea, but I can speculate: *1.* Berkeley is a top school, I shouldn't (and didn't) expect to get into any of these top schools. *2.* Of all the schools, I had decidedly the weakest area match with potential advisors at Berkeley. *3.* I've heard that Berkeley puts more than a usual weight on GRE scores, and mine were not the strongest (V: 165/95%, Q: 161/79%, A: 5/93%).
