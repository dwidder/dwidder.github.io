College costs a lot of money: the average college graduate is  [$31,100 in the hole on graduation](http://ticas.org/posd/map-state-data). This is my guide to college success, after (almost) 4 years of college and 2 years as a [Resident Assistant](_posts/2017-3-21-Resident-Assistant-Reflections) to getting the most out of your or your parents money. It's based on an analysis of my own successes, things I learned from failures, and those of my residents and friends. I give a lot of thought to process: what works and what doesn't, what processes lead to which outcomes, and how to optimize processes to achieve certain goals.

## Choosing Your Major
There are a few factors which should influence your choice of major, but how you prioritize each is a personal choice:
1. Employability
2. Enjoyability
3. Your past experience
4. Advice from parents and friends

## Eyes on ***a*** Prize
If you know exactly what you want to do after college, good! Spend your time accordingly, and pursue that goal ruthlessly. But if you don't, don't worry, just pick something that sounds reasonably interesting and work towards it, but be open to new ideas.

This includes declaring and taking classes in a major as soon as you enter, even if you're not 100% sure its for you. Why? Because taking a few classes in a major is the best way to decide if it *is* for you,

## Extra Curriculars

## Summers!

## Be Social
Many opportunities come from being known. Talk to everyone: professors

## The A Game
You've heard it before: ultimately you're here to get a degree. Getting a degree with a good GPA is not a ticket to success, but a bad GPA is certainly a barrier. Here is how to get the most out of your classes, and how to get a number as close to a 4.0 with as much ease as possible.

### Go to Office Hours!
If only there was a way to get free tutoring a few times a week from someone with a PhD in the subject you're trying to learn? Imagine if that person also writes the exam/ grades the essay you're trying to do well on? Yeah: go to office hours. Other people probably won't be there, and even if they are, their questions will probably help you too. Even if you aren't struggling or don't have a pressing question, go a few times, because having professors who like you and think you are smart is a really good thing. Ask a question about the content

## Choose Classes and Professors Carefully
Choose classes intentionally, there are often many different classes you can take to fulfill the same requirement.

Also, unlike high school, you're being taught by someone whose primary task isn't to teach. Professors keep their job by doing good research rather than good teaching, and therefore the quality of their instruction varies wildly! Read course reviews (and do!) your course reviews, do read the reviews on [RateMyProfessor.com]()
