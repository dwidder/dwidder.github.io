title: "College Success: Get What You Pay For"

College costs a lot of money: the average college graduate is  [$31,100 in the hole on graduation](http://ticas.org/posd/map-state-data). This is my guide to college success, after (almost) four years of college and two years as a [Resident Assistant](/Resident-Assistant-Reflections) to getting the most out of your (or your parents' ;-) ) money. It's based on an analysis of my own successes, things I learned from my failures, and those of my residents and friends. I give a lot of thought to process: what works and what doesn't, what processes lead to which outcomes, and how to optimize processes to achieve certain goals.

## Eyes on ***a*** Prize
If you know exactly what you want to do after college, good! Pursue that goal ruthlessly. But if you don't, don't worry, just pick something that sounds reasonably interesting and work towards it, while being open to new ideas.

This includes declaring and taking classes in a major as soon as you enter, even if you're not 100% sure its for you. Why? Because taking a few classes in a major is the best way to decide if it *is* for you, but more importantly, you get many ancillary benefits as a result. You'll get dedicated advisors who will keep you on track to graduate on time. You'll get access to free resources many majors have, such as free tutoring, printing, and computer labs.

If you have *no* idea where to start, here's are a few factors which should influence your choice of major, but how you prioritize each is a personal choice.
1. **Employability:** How likely is this degree going to lead to a career which will let you live the kind of life you want to live? Do your own research, find people doing work you want may want to do in the future and see what their educational background is. Don't trust advisors on this one: so far as they are concerned, their major is the "most applicable, most employable" offered.
2. **Enjoyability:** How likely are you going to enjoy the heaps of work you'll have to do for your classes? If you hate essays, an English major isn't for you. If you hate being stuck behind a computer, don't be a computer science major. You're going to work hard no matter what you pick, but the key is to enjoy the work.
3. **Your past experience:** Think back to your high school classes, jobs, or gen ed classes you've already taken. What skills did you learn from these? Which ones did you enjoy? This will give you a sense of what you'll be good at, and what you'll enjoy.
4. **Parental expectations:** This depends on your family situation. My parents wanted me to study something that would be employable, but after that they weren't too concerned. Luckily, CS is known to be employable, but I also don't know if I would have taken their advice if I had wanted to do something else.

## The A Game
You've heard it before: ultimately you're here to get a degree. Getting a degree with a good GPA is not a ticket to success, but a bad GPA is certainly a barrier. Here is how to get the most out of your classes, and how to get a number as close to a 4.0 with as much ease as possible.

### Go to Office Hours!
If only there was a way to get free tutoring a few times a week from someone with a PhD in the subject you're trying to learn? Imagine if that person also writes the exam/ grades the essay you're trying to do well on? Yeah: go to office hours. Other people probably won't be there, and even if they are, their questions will probably help you too. Even if you aren't struggling or don't have a pressing question, go a few times, because having professors who like you and think you are smart is a really good thing. Ask a question about the reading, or ask to hear more about something mentioned in class. Being known to your professors is helpful when it comes time for them to assign grades, but more importantly when you need letters of reference to apply for internships, jobs, scholarships, and grad school. If you do one thing differently after reading this article, go to each of your professor's office hours some time this term.

### Choose Classes and Professors Carefully
Choose classes intentionally, there are often many different classes you can take to fulfill the same requirement. You have natural talents, pick classes which fit those. You're also more likely to work hard at something you're interested in. If you're undecided between two courses, register for both and attend them both for the first week. Check, but you can likely get your money back when you drop one once you've decided which you want to take.

Also, unlike high school, you're being taught by someone whose primary task isn't to teach. Professors keep their job by doing good research rather than good teaching, and therefore the quality of their instruction varies wildly! Read course reviews and read the reviews on [RateMyProfessor.com](ratemyprofessor.com). Pay attention to the comments, not the score. In my experience there are often one or two "star teachers" in each department who come highly recommended from peers, try to take classes from them when possible.

### Study Habits
- Read and start each assignment the day it is assigned, even if that's just writing a few sentences of the introduction or doing the first  problems in a problem set. This will do a few things: • You'll naturally start to think of ideas for that essay, or ways to solve the harder problems. • You'll get a sense of how 'big' the assignment is and therefore how much time you'll need to do it, which can help prevent sad surprises.

## Be Social
Many opportunities come from being known, and from being liked. Learn to talk about what you're good at in a way that makes you seem enthusiastic, not arrogant.
