title: How Not to Pick a Grad School
categories: grad-school satire
---

I've been traveling a lot lately to visit grad schools, and I've gotten a chance to talk to inspiring people and hear about their fascinating research.

In particular, I've visited Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Washington, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Each time I visit one school, the choice becomes harder; but then I remember that I will be happy no matter where I end up, and that there are therefore no bad options.  

I've also come up with metrics by which, if I was less serious about school, would help me choose which school to attend. This is a light hearted article reflecting on my grad school visit days, including criteria ranging from satirical to only marginally important in my selection process.

### Size of Airport
CMU is in Pittsburgh, UW is in Seattle, and GA Tech is in Atlanta. Trying to fly from Eugene, Oregon with its tiny regional airport to each of these cities has made me appreciate the extent to which living near a large 'hub' airport makes life easier.

**Verdict:** Atlanta is Delta Airlines' home airport, making ATL's coverage map look like a spider dog-pile. Georgia Tech takes the cake here.

### Quality of Food Bribes
I am only partly kidding when I allege that grad schools are trying to bribe me 

### Amount of Alcohol at the Grad Student Party
