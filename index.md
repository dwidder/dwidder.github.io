I am a Software Engineering PhD student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s [Institute for Software Research](http://isri.cmu.edu/index.html) in the [School of Computer Scieince](https://www.cs.cmu.edu). I am advised by [Laura Dabbish](http://www.lauradabbish.com) and [Jim Herbsleb](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/herbsleb-james.html), and a proud member of the [CoEx](http://coexlab.com) and [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io) teams. I do [research](/research) at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction, on topics such as diversity and inclusion in open source communities, and tool choice in dev ops environments. 

I earned my BS in June 2017 from the [Robert D. Clark Honors College](http://honors.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon where I studied Computer and Information Science. I wrote my Undergraduate Thesis on the programming practices of scientific research programmers, and was advised by [Professor Stephen Fickas](http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~fickas/new_home/).

I was born in [Tillamook, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook,_Oregon) but grew up in Berlin, Germany and Singapore. Apart from my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and climbing.

I am always excited to meet new people and hear about new ideas and opportunities. Feel free to [reach out!](/contact)
