David Gray Widder (he/him) studies how people creating "Artificial Intelligence" systems think about the downstream harms their systems make possible, and the wider cultural, political, and economic logics which shape these thoughts. He is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu) at Cornell Tech, and earned his PhD from the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University. He has previously conducted research at Intel Labs, Microsoft Research, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His recent work has appeared in [FA](https://davidwidder.me/files/widder-ossdeepfakes-facct22.pdf)[ccT](https://davidwidder.me/power.pdf), [CHI](https://davidwidder.me/files/trust-automation-widder.pdf), [CSCW](https://davidwidder.me/files/frluckaj-gender-cscw2023.pdf), and [Big Data & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517231177620).
