I am a student in the Clark D. Honors College at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon studying Computer and Information Science. I do research at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction. I was born in Tillamook, Oregon but grew up in Berlin, Germany and Singapore. Apart from my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and rowing.

I am always excited to meet new people and hear about new ideas and opportunities. Feel free to [reach out!](/contact)
