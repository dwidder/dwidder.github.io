I am a student in the [Robert D. Clark Honors College](http://honors.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon studying Computer and Information Science. I am excited to move to Pittsburgh in August 2017 to pursue a PhD in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s [Institute for Software Research](http://isri.cmu.edu/index.html).

I do [research](/research) at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction, with an aim to improve Computer Science Education. I was born in [Tillamook, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook,_Oregon) but grew up in Berlin, Germany and Singapore. Apart from my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and rowing.

I am always excited to meet new people and hear about new ideas and opportunities. Feel free to [reach out!](/contact)
