I am a student in the Clark D. Honors College at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon studying Computer and Information Science. I do research at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction. I was born in Tillamook, Oregon but grew up in Berlin, Germany and Singapore. Apart from my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and rowing.

I sometimes do cool things like write papers and submit them to conferences.
