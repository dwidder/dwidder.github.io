I am a Software Engineering PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University’s [Institute for Software Research](http://isri.cmu.edu/index.html) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu). I am advised by [Laura Dabbish](http://www.lauradabbish.com), [Jim Herbsleb](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/herbsleb-james.html), and [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io) and a proud member of the [CoEx](http://coexlab.com) and [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io) teams. I do [research](/research) at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction, on topics such as diversity and inclusion in open source communities, tool choice in dev ops environments, and recently, human factors such as ethics and trust in Artificial Intelligence use in workplace settings.

I earned my BS in June 2017 from the [Robert D. Clark Honors College](http://honors.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon where I studied Computer and Information Science. I wrote my Undergraduate Thesis on the programming practices of scientific research programmers, and was advised by [Professor Stephen Fickas](http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~fickas/new_home/).

I was born in [Tillamook, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook,_Oregon) but grew up in Berlin, Germany and Singapore. Apart from my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and climbing.

I am always excited to meet new people and hear about new ideas and opportunities. Feel free to [reach out!](/contact)
