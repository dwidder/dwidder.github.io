In addition to my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and rowing.

### Painting

When I travel, I enjoy painting watercolor sketches of the sights I see. I also love studio painting, where I usually use acrylic paints. I have a [Facebook album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10202558628021541.1073741850.1071404900&type=1&l=d90041d14b) with a few light sketches as well as some more serious paintings.

### Running

Often an activity I do when I want to think through things or to ease stress, I love running through parks and along rivers. My favorite distances to run are 5k and 10k, but I'll also run the occasional half marathon.

### Rowing

I am an alumnus of the University of Oregon [Rowing Team](https://www.uorowing.org). I sincerely miss waking up at 4:30 am six days a week to watch the sun and our heart rates rise over the mountain peaks.
