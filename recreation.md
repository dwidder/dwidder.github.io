In addition to my research interests, I enjoy painting, running and rowing.

### Painting

When I travel, I enjoy painting watercolor sketches of the sights I see. I also love studio painting, where I usually use acrylic paints.

### Running

Often an activity I do when I want to think through things or to ease stress, I love running through parks and along rivers. My favorite distances to run are 5k and 10k, but I'll run the occasional half marathon. 

### Rowing

I am proud to be on the University of Oregon [Rowing Team](https://www.uorowing.org). We wake up at 4:30 am six days a week, and watch the sun rise over the mountain peaks as our heart rates rise.
