I conduct research at the intersection of Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction and Computing Education. I want to understand how people's education and lived experience influences the way they write code, and I want to apply these insights to improve the state of Computer Science education. Much of my research has been conducted in collaboration with Professor [Stephen Fickas](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/People/Faculty/Stephen_Fickas.php) at UO.

You can download my current one page resume detailing my research and other experience [here](/files/Widder_Resume.pdf). Once I have a non trivial number of publications, I'll convert this to a fancy CV.

### Publications

#### [What are barriers to efficient ROS debugging?](/files/REU 2016 Poster Large.pdf) July 28, 2016

*David Gray Widder, Josh Sunshine, Claire Le Goues*

Poster presenting my research conducted at CMU's [REUSE 2016](http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html). I found directives in documentation for the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org), created tasks based on these directives, and then had 12 participants complete these tasks 22 times while thinking aloud so that I could study the barriers they face while doing so.
